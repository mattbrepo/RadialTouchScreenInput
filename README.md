# RadialTouchScreenInput
Prototype for a new Touchscreen input UI.

**Language: Javascript**

**Start: 2014**

## Why
I was working on CNC touchscreen user interfaces, where often the user only needs to change a value a bit to adjust the behavior of the machine. I built this prototype as a proof of concept of a simplified user interface to quickly change a numerical value using a finger or the mouse. The user can change the value in increments of 1 or 0.1 (either positive or negative) by moving the finger / mouse in the appropriate quadrant.
